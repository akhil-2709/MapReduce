 for the bliss of souls like mine I am so happy my dear friend so absorbed in the exquisite sense of 
 foliage of my trees and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary I throw myself down among 
 in his own image and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us as it floats around us 
 within me that it might be the mirror of my soul as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend
