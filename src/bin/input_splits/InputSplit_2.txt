I enjoy with my whole heart I am alone and feel the charm of existence in this spot which was created
 valley teems with vapour around me and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable 
 indescribable forms of the insects and flies then I feel the presence of the Almighty who formed us 
 Oh would I could describe these conceptions could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm
